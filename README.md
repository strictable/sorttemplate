# Go Variable Sorter Template

`sorttemplate` is a versatile Go library that allows you to sort slices or arrays of any variable type using a template-based approach. It leverages Go's generics (introduced in Go 1.18) to provide a flexible and efficient solution for sorting any kind of data structure, such as integers, strings, structs, and more.

## Features

- Sort any type of slice or array (e.g., integers, floats, strings, structs).
- Supports custom sorting logic via user-defined comparison functions.
- Generic and flexible, utilizing Go 1.18+ generics.
- Works with built-in types or custom structs.
- Easily configurable sorting order: ascending or descending.

## Installation

To install `sorttemplate`, run the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/strictable/sorttemplate
